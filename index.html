					<h1>Interest in IT</h1>
				</div>
				
				<div class="sectionContent">
					<p>•At a time when the Internet and computers were not as popular as they are today. My father brought me to the internet and computers, so I had a keen interest in these from a young age. That's why I chose to study IT. To this day programming is something that interests me more because in my view it can achieve anything. Nowadays we can't live without the internet and IT. I believe it will become more and more important in the future.</p>
					<p>•I heard that RMIT has good IT resources and rankings. My friend recommended RMIT's IT program to me. For me RMIT is indeed a good and excellent choice.</p>
					<p>•I hope that my time at RMIT will give me a deeper understanding and learning about IT. For example, programming and artificial intelligence etc. It will allow me to feel more interested in IT and at the same time keep me motivated for my future studies.</p>

					<h2>Job Title</h2>
					<h3>Description</h3>
					<img src="photo2.jpeg" width="400" height="200"/>
					<p>This is a software programmer position and is part of the developer. What appeals to me is that it is a continuous job. Firstly, it requires software programming and is developed in a team. Then it needs to be improved and refined slowly. This process is also attractive to me. <a href="https://www.seek.com.au/job/53388971?type=standard#searchRequestToken=47452d76-b1c0-437f-871f-567bf8c8a8e9">https://www.seek.com.au/job/53388971?type=standard#searchRequestToken=47452d76-b1c0-437f-871f-567bf8c8a8e9</a> </p>
					<h3>Skills I have</h3>
					<p>So far my professional skills are few and immature. I know some programming languages such as java, python, but not enough to do more difficult work, so I have a lot to learn. And I have no experience in this area.</p>
					<h3>Skills I Need</h3>
					<p>This position requires knowledge of coding languages - VBA, MS Access and SQL. Not only computer infrastructure is required but also excellent database administration skills and experience.</p>
					<h3>Learning Plan</h3>
					<p>Firstly, you need to learn the coding language - VBA, MS Access and SQL, etc. Secondly, I need to have knowledge of databases and database management, which is something I need to learn. Finally, software programming is also very important. I don't have enough mature skills or experience for now, so it would be a good experience to do some projects in my future studies</p>

				<h1>Personality Profile</h1>

					<h2>Myers Briggs Type Indicator</h2>
					<p>Adventurer personalities are true artists, but not necessarily in the typical sense where they’re out painting happy little trees. Often enough though, they are perfectly capable of this. Rather, it’s that they use aesthetics, design and even their choices and actions to push the limits of social convention. Adventurers enjoy upsetting traditional expectations with experiments in beauty and behavior – chances are, they’ve expressed more than once the phrase “Don’t box me in!”</p>
					<h3>Strengths</h3>
					<p>Charming – People with the Adventurer personality type are relaxed and warm, and their “live and let live” attitude naturally makes them likable and popular.
Sensitive to Others – Adventurers easily relate to others’ emotions, helping them to establish harmony and good will, and minimize conflict.
Imaginative – Being so aware of others’ emotions, Adventurer personalities use creativity and insight to craft bold ideas that speak to people’s hearts. While it’s hard to explain this quality on a resume, this vivid imagination and exploratory spirit help Adventurers in unexpected ways.
Passionate – Beneath Adventurers’ quiet shyness beats an intensely feeling heart. When people with this personality type are caught up in something exciting and interesting, they can leave everything else in the dust.
Curious – Ideas are well and good, but Adventurers need to see and explore for themselves whether their ideas ring true. Work revolving around the sciences may seem a poor match for their traits, but a boldly artistic and humanistic vision is often exactly what research needs to move forward – if Adventurers are given the freedom they need to do so.
Artistic – Adventurers are able to show their creativity in tangible ways and with stunning beauty. Whether writing a song, painting an emotion, or presenting a statistic in a graph, Adventurers have a way of visualizing things that resonates with their audience.</p>
					<h3>Weaknesses</h3>
					<p>Fiercely Independent – Freedom of expression is often Adventurers’ top priority. Anything that interferes with that, like traditions and hard rules, creates a sense of oppression for Adventurer personalities. This can make more rigidly structured academics and work a challenge.
Unpredictable – Adventurers’ dislike long-term commitments and plans. The tendency to actively avoid planning for the future can cause strain in Adventurers’ romantic relationships and financial hardship later in life.
Easily Stressed – Adventurers live in the present, full of emotion. When situations get out of control, people with this personality type (especially Turbulent ones) can shut down, losing their characteristic charm and creativity in favor of gnashing teeth.
Overly Competitive – Adventurers can escalate small things into intense competitions, turning down long-term success in their search for glory in the moment, and are unhappy when they lose.
Fluctuating Self-Esteem – It’s demanded that skills be quantified, but that’s hard to do with Adventurers’ strengths of sensitivity and artistry. Adventurers’ efforts are often dismissed, a hurtful and damaging blow, especially early in life. Adventurers can start to believe the naysayers without strong support.</p>
