					<h1>Interest in IT</h1>
				</div>
				
				<div class="sectionContent">
					<p>•At a time when the Internet and computers were not as popular as they are today. My father brought me to the internet and computers, so I had a keen interest in these from a young age. That's why I chose to study IT. To this day programming is something that interests me more because in my view it can achieve anything. Nowadays we can't live without the internet and IT. I believe it will become more and more important in the future.</p>
					<p>•I heard that RMIT has good IT resources and rankings. My friend recommended RMIT's IT program to me. For me RMIT is indeed a good and excellent choice.</p>
					<p>•I hope that my time at RMIT will give me a deeper understanding and learning about IT. For example, programming and artificial intelligence etc. It will allow me to feel more interested in IT and at the same time keep me motivated for my future studies.</p>

					<h3>Description</h3>
					<img src="photo2.jpeg" width="400" height="200"/>
					<p>This is a software programmer position and is part of the developer. What appeals to me is that it is a continuous job. Firstly, it requires software programming and is developed in a team. Then it needs to be improved and refined slowly. This process is also attractive to me. <a href="https://www.seek.com.au/job/53388971?type=standard#searchRequestToken=47452d76-b1c0-437f-871f-567bf8c8a8e9">https://www.seek.com.au/job/53388971?type=standard#searchRequestToken=47452d76-b1c0-437f-871f-567bf8c8a8e9</a> </p>
					<h3>Skills I have</h3>
					<p>So far my professional skills are few and immature. I know some programming languages such as java, python, but not enough to do more difficult work, so I have a lot to learn. And I have no experience in this area.</p>
					<h3>Skills I Need</h3>
					<p>This position requires knowledge of coding languages - VBA, MS Access and SQL. Not only computer infrastructure is required but also excellent database administration skills and experience.</p>
					<h3>Learning Plan</h3>
					<p>Firstly, you need to learn the coding language - VBA, MS Access and SQL, etc. Secondly, I need to have knowledge of databases and database management, which is something I need to learn. Finally, software programming is also very important. I don't have enough mature skills or experience for now, so it would be a good experience to do some projects in my future studies</p>

				<h1>Personality Profile</h1>
			</div>
			
			<div class="sectionContent">
				<article>
					<h3>Myers Briggs Type Indicator</h3>
					<p>Adventurer personalities are true artists, but not necessarily in the typical sense where they’re out painting happy little trees. Often enough though, they are perfectly capable of this. Rather, it’s that they use aesthetics, design and even their choices and actions to push the limits of social convention. Adventurers enjoy upsetting traditional expectations with experiments in beauty and behavior – chances are, they’ve expressed more than once the phrase “Don’t box me in!”</p>
					<h3>Strengths</h3>
					<p>Charming – People with the Adventurer personality type are relaxed and warm, and their “live and let live” attitude naturally makes them likable and popular.
Sensitive to Others – Adventurers easily relate to others’ emotions, helping them to establish harmony and good will, and minimize conflict.
Imaginative – Being so aware of others’ emotions, Adventurer personalities use creativity and insight to craft bold ideas that speak to people’s hearts. While it’s hard to explain this quality on a resume, this vivid imagination and exploratory spirit help Adventurers in unexpected ways.
Passionate – Beneath Adventurers’ quiet shyness beats an intensely feeling heart. When people with this personality type are caught up in something exciting and interesting, they can leave everything else in the dust.
Curious – Ideas are well and good, but Adventurers need to see and explore for themselves whether their ideas ring true. Work revolving around the sciences may seem a poor match for their traits, but a boldly artistic and humanistic vision is often exactly what research needs to move forward – if Adventurers are given the freedom they need to do so.
Artistic – Adventurers are able to show their creativity in tangible ways and with stunning beauty. Whether writing a song, painting an emotion, or presenting a statistic in a graph, Adventurers have a way of visualizing things that resonates with their audience.</p>
					<h3>Weaknesses</h3>
					<p>Fiercely Independent – Freedom of expression is often Adventurers’ top priority. Anything that interferes with that, like traditions and hard rules, creates a sense of oppression for Adventurer personalities. This can make more rigidly structured academics and work a challenge.
Unpredictable – Adventurers’ dislike long-term commitments and plans. The tendency to actively avoid planning for the future can cause strain in Adventurers’ romantic relationships and financial hardship later in life.
Easily Stressed – Adventurers live in the present, full of emotion. When situations get out of control, people with this personality type (especially Turbulent ones) can shut down, losing their characteristic charm and creativity in favor of gnashing teeth.
Overly Competitive – Adventurers can escalate small things into intense competitions, turning down long-term success in their search for glory in the moment, and are unhappy when they lose.
Fluctuating Self-Esteem – It’s demanded that skills be quantified, but that’s hard to do with Adventurers’ strengths of sensitivity and artistry. Adventurers’ efforts are often dismissed, a hurtful and damaging blow, especially early in life. Adventurers can start to believe the naysayers without strong support.</p>
					<h3>Team Composition</h3>
					<p>The results of these tests give a clearer indication of personality and learning. It can give me a clearer picture of myself and my strengths and weaknesses. In terms of teamwork, I probably prefer to be organised and would like someone else to lead the team. At the same time, I have to communicate more to face others, and I hope to improve and complement with others.</p>

					<h2>Test Two</h2>
					<p class="subDetails">Learning Preferences</p>
					<p>Visual
If you are a visual learner, you learn by reading or seeing pictures. You understand and remember things by sight. You can picture what you are learning in your head, and you learn best by using methods that are primarily visual. You like to see what you are learning. As a visual learner, you are usually neat and clean. You often close your eyes to visualize or remember something, and you will find something to watch if you become bored. You may have difficulty with spoken directions and may be easily distracted by sounds. You are attracted to color and to spoken language (like stories) that is rich in imagery.</p>

				<h1>Project Idea</h1>
			</div>
			
			<div class="sectionContent">
				<article>
					<h2>Overview</h2>
					<p>An umbrella that can act like a self-driving car could be an effective solution to the inconvenience of travelling in rainy weather.</p>
				</article>

				<article>
					<h2>Motivation</h2>
					<p>Most people don't like travelling in the rain. Not only because of the cold and wet, but also because of the inconvenience of travelling. Umbrellas are essential for travelling in the rain, but they are very inconvenient to hold on to yourself. You also have to be aware of tree branches, pedestrians and their umbrellas on the road to avoid collisions.</p>
				</article>
				
				<article>
					<h2>Description</h2>
					<p>My project idea is a smart umbrella that can avoid obstacles like a self-driving car.</p>
					<p>Firstly, it is very inconvenient to travel in the rain with one hand on the umbrella. So the umbrella needs to be able to hover right above a person's head and be able to recognise the user's position and keep track of it, so that it can follow the user at all times. My idea is that the user could carry a reader on his or her person that could be connected to the umbrella to identify the user's location. I think it would be possible to attach a drone like propeller to the umbrella so that it can stay aloft and adjust its height.</p>
					<p>Secondly, we need to be aware of obstacles such as branches or buildings, as well as pedestrians and their umbrellas on the road. We sometimes need to adjust the height and position of the umbrella to avoid scrapes. I think it is possible to add a 360 degree camera and processor to the umbrella. The camera takes live footage and sends the data to the processor, which determines the obstacle and adjusts the height and position with the propeller. This would enable automatic obstacle avoidance.</p>

				</article>

				<article>
					<h2>Tools and Technologies</h2>
					<p>The canopy, propellers, cameras, sensors and processors are the main hardware tools. The key technology lies in the sensing technology of the surrounding information, the high sensitivity and high performance of the various sensors and information processing technology of artificial intelligence that replaces the five human senses.</p>
				</article>

				<article>
					<h2>Skills Required</h2>
					<p>The need for a system or program that allows the processor to automatically identify obstacles and avoid them is key to this project. I think it is very feasible to make a project, but it is still difficult to develop and mature.</p>
				</article>

				<article>
					<h2>Outcome</h2>
					<p>If this project is successful and mature, it will greatly facilitate our travel in the rain. However, I think that the price may affect the demand for this project, so it will be a long time before this project can really happen.</p>
